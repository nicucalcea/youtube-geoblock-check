# youtube-geoblock-check
Is a YouTube video blocked in your country? This browser extension will tell you where it is available.


# Setting up
Install the extension from the [Firefox Add-ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/youtube-geoblock-checker/).

Once installed, open the Extensions setting (`about:addons`) in your browser and find the add-on. Click on the three dots (`â‹®`) and the select `Options`.

At this stage, you'll need a YouTube Data API key. Go to [Google's developer portal](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) for instructions on how to get one.

Once you've got a key, paste it into the add-on settings and click save.

That's it!
